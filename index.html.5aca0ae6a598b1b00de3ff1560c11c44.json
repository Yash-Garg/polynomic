SVG path strings are often quite hard to manipulate because of their nature; you have to parse them and analyze the SVG code to be able to perform some modifications.</p>\n<p>The main goal of Polynomic is to provide an easy way to parse, normalize and edit SVG paths.</p>\n<h2 id=\"get-started\"><a href=\"#get-started\" class=\"phenomic-HeadingAnchor\">#</a>Get started</h2>\n<p>Begin by installing the library using NPM:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-sh\">npm install --save polynomic</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"basic-usage\"><a href=\"#basic-usage\" class=\"phenomic-HeadingAnchor\">#</a>Basic usage</h2>\n<p>The process is very simple. Polynomic will parse a given pathstring to generate a normalized array of points. Then, you just have to call functions (e.g. 2D transforms) on this array to edit the path, and build a new pathstring that you can inject in the DOM.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-js\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">import</span> Polynomic <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"polynomic\"</span>\n\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">// Parse a pathstring and build a normalized array of points</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">let</span> path = Polynomic.pathstring.parse(<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"M0 0 L100 0 L100 100 L0 100 z\"</span>)\n\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">// Perform some transforms on the path</span>\npath = Polynomic.transforms.rotate(path, <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">Math</span>.PI / <span class=\"hljs-number\">4</span>, <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"center\"</span>, <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"center\"</span>)\npath = Polynomic.transforms.translate(path, <span class=\"hljs-number\">25</span>, <span class=\"hljs-number\">50</span>)\n\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">// Get the new pathstring</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span> pathstring = Polynomic.pathstring.build(path)\n\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">// ➜ \"M75 29.289L145.711 100L75 170.711L4.289 100z\"</span></code></pre>\n<p>Want to go further?
